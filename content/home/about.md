# Biography

I believe that everyone is skilled in something he loves a lot ! Coding, doing research and organizing are my hobbies and I am skilled in.
I am PhD in Telecommunication & Information Processing, and I work as Assistant Professor at UMMTO University. I received my PhD from USTHB 
University in 2016 (started in February 2013), and the MSc in Pattern Recognition & AI from UBMA, in 2012. 

I am careful and punctual, as well as I am recognized for my reliability, my analytical, strategic and challenging spirit. My goal is to 
tap my full potential to contribute in the technological development. I have very strong programming skills  
with +10 years of experience, an organizational and leadership sense with +6 years of experience. 

I have the ability to conduct researches autonomously, or to work within a team. My research interests primarily lie in 
computational linguistics including Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and Arabic Morphology. I am also interested in 
Robotics, IoT, Automatic Scheduling and Computer Vision. Finally, I am hobbyist in Robotics, DIY, Spearfishing, Trekking and Camping.
