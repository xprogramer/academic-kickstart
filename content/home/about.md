# Biography

I believe that everyone is skilled in something he loves a lot ! Coding, doing research and organizing are my hobbies and I am skilled in. I am excited about bridging the gap between the digital world and the human social interactions. In particular, I am interested in understanding the socio-linguistic situation in Algeria, as it is known as complex due to the large variety of cultures and dialects spoken within. In this regard, my research interests lie in computational linguistics with a focus on Arabic langage and the Algerian dialects. In addition, I am also interested in robotics and IoT.

I am Associate Professor at Guelma University. I received my PhD in Telecommunication & Information Processing from USTHB University in 2016, and the MSc in Pattern Recognition & AI from UBMA University, in 2012. I serve as reviewer in some conferences and renowned journals. I spend my free time in reading books and articles to learn new skills, as well as making nice electronic prototypes and CNC machines. I love camping and discover the beauty of the nature, spearfishing and sports.
