# Biography

I believe that everyone is skilled in something he loves a lot ! Coding, doing research and organizing are my hobbies and I am skilled in. I am excited about bridging the gap between the digital world and the human social interactions. In particular, I am interested in understanding the socio-linguistic situation in Algeria, as it is known as complex due to the large variety of cultures and dialects spoken within. In this regard, my research interests lie in computational linguistics with a focus on Arabic langage and the Algerian dialects.

I am Assistant Professor at Guelma University. I received my PhD from USTHB University in 2016 (started in February 2013), and the MSc in Pattern Recognition & AI from UBMA, in 2012. I am careful and punctual, as well as I am recognized for my reliability, my analytical, strategic and challenging spirit. I have the ability to conduct researches autonomously, or to work within a team.

I serve as reviewer in some conferences and renowned journals like Lrev, Information sciences, etc. In addition, I spend my free time in helping hobbyists to realize their electronic projects, as well as traveling, camping, spearfishing and sports.
