This paper addresses the problem of detecting the offensive and abusive content in Facebook 
comments, where we focus on the Algerian dialectal Arabic which is one of under-resourced languages. 
The latter has a variety of dialects mixed with different languages (i.e. Berber, French and English). 
In addition, we deal with texts written in both Arabic and Roman scripts (i.e. Arabizi). Due to the 
scarcity of works on the same language, we have built a new corpus regrouping more than 8.7k texts 
manually annotated as normal, abusive and offensive. We have conducted a series of experiments using 
the state-of-the-art classifiers of text categorisation, namely: BiLSTM, CNN, FastText, SVM and NB. 
The results showed acceptable performances, but the problem requires further investigation on linguistic 
features to increase the identification accuracy.
